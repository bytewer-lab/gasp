# GASP vs Pre-commit

While both GASP and pre-commit serve similar purposes in managing Git hooks, they take different approaches. Here's a detailed comparison to help you choose the right tool for your needs.

## Feature Comparison

| Aspect | GASP | Pre-commit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Language** | Go (bin√°rio compilado) | Python (interpretado) |
| **Installation** | Single binary, no dependencies | Requires Python + pip install |
| **Performance** | Faster (Go native) | Slower (Python + overhead) |
| **Configuration** | Simple shell scripts in `hooks/` | Complex YAML (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) |
| **Hook Structure** | `hooks/` directory with executables | Remote repos + YAML config |
| **Cross-platform** | Windows, Linux, macOS | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| **Dependencies** | No external dependencies | Manages dependencies automatically |
| **Available Hooks** | Custom local scripts | Vast ecosystem of ready hooks |
| **Setup Ease** | Very simple: scripts in hooks/ | Requires YAML and repo knowledge |
| **Hook Versioning** | With project | Via repository tags |
| **Updates** | With project dependencies | `pre-commit autoupdate` |
| **Flexibility** | High (any shell script) | High (multiple languages/tools) |
| **Learning Curve** | Low (basic shell knowledge) | Medium-high (YAML, pre-commit concepts) |
| **Environment** | No isolation | Isolated virtual environments |
| **Caching** | Not implemented | Integrated cache system |
| **Debugging** | Direct script output | Detailed logs and verbose mode |
| **Portability** | Portable binary | Requires Python environment |
| **Maintenance** | Low (few features) | Medium (complex ecosystem) |
| **Community** | Small/new | Large and active |
| **Documentation** | Limited | Extensive and complete |
